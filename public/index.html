    <h1>Five Old Rolls</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Birthday Boy</h2>
      <p>It's February 1st, 2014. I'm 42 today.</p>
      <p>42 is a good number. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Thought_%28The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29#Deep_Thought">Deep Thought</a>, it's the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything. And that's good enough for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rummaging Around</h2>
      <p>Today was a pretty good day. My family gave me some nifty presents, I got a heap of birthday wishes from friends, and the weather was about as nice as is ever gets in the dead of winter in Massachusetts. It's been a busy week, and I decided that I'd take it easy today, enjoy some family time and just relax. And that's pretty much the way the day has gone.</p>
      <p>At some point, Karen asked me to climb under the stairs, into one of the few storage areas in our little house, and pull out the box of overflow kitchen appliances. The start of February seems like a good time to put away the drip coffee maker we only pull out when my mother-in-law is in town. After all, she'd left the day after Christmas.</p>
      <p>Of course, the applicance box was shoved in with a mess of other storage containers. The pile has somehow become a bit unruly in recent weeks. I've been meaning to get down there and clean up for a while. And now seemed like a good time to take a crack at it. I started to pull out the boxes, intent on getting the applicance box first and at least completing the first job, getting the coffee maker put away. I could see the box I wanted, but there was another one in the way. I peered through the side of the plastic container, trying to get some idea of the contents. "Oh, that's my camera gear", I said to myself.</p>
      <p>I've been interested in photography for a long time, and over the years, I've put together an OK kit. I've got some decent lenses, an aging but still servicable DSLR, and some other gear in that box. Everything had been crated away when we broke down our old office in prep for moving our daughter into the larger room. And now, months later, we're just getting the office back together in its new location. "I'll just carry this upstairs when I'm done here", I thought, "And then I can put this stuff away properly." And that's where I found the five rolls.</p>

      <h2>Nostaligia</h2>
      <p>It's been years since I shot with film. I made the switch to digital photography almost a decade ago.</p>
      <p>I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_20D">Canon 20D</a> in 2004. It was an exciting thing to do back then. There were still plenty of folks shooting on film back then, though the writing was on the wall. DSLRs and advanced image editing software were getting cheap enough for prosumers and serious photographers were letting go of film quicker than I think anyone really expected. After all, so many of us had come to love the flaws and quirks of our film stock of choice. The graininess of T-MAX, the weirdly rich tones of Velvia slides. Ask any film photographer and I'm sure they'd have a favorite/. How could cold digital match that? And don't even get me started on the papers.</p>
      <p>Well, here we are in 2014 and if you're still shotting on film, you're an anomaly. Digital cameras have almost entirely supplanted film. So many of the old manufacturerer of film stock have scaled back or shuttered their product lines entirely. Sure, there are still people who use film everyday, but it's not the default choice any longer.</p>
      <p>As I was going through my gear, putting things away on shelves in the office, I came across a box. I'm sure I must have noticed it when I emptied out the cabinet in the office all those months ago, but it didn't really register with me back then. The box isn't much to look at, but it's got some interseting stuff printed on the side: "Agfa Scale 200x".</p>
      <p>You may not be familiar Agfa Scala; it wasn't exactly a household film. Scala 200x is a black-and-white slide film, with an ISO 200 film speed. One of the things that made Scala so cool, besides the quality of the images you could get from it, was that it could be exposed at a really wide range of speeds, from ISO 100-1600. This is a big deal with slide film, which is usually required precise exposure. So there was something magical about Scala. It was also annoying, as it required a special development process. You had to send your Scala to Agfa or a speciality processor. That was fine for pros, but it certainly didn't make it easy to use for the average person. And it wasn't cheap, either.</p>
      <p>Agfa stopped making Scala sometime in the last decade (though I've seen at least one thing on the Internet implying that Scala isn't entirely dead). And here I have a box, and in that box are three rolls of Scala.</p>
      <p>And I'm excited about that.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The Five Old Rolls</h2>
      <p>I've got three rolls of old(ish) black-and-white slide film. And while I was rummaging around, I found two unshot rolls of Kodak Portra 400VC I picked up to shoot a friends wedding.<p> 
      <p>What exactly am I going to do with this old junk? Shoot it, of course.</p>
      <p>I still have my pre-digital SLR, a Canon Elan7 that was the first camera I ever bought for myself (before the Elan, I used my dad's old AE-1). I've been "in system" with Canon for decades, so it shouldn't be hard to get the old girl going again. All I need now are some suitable subjects and some great light. Each roll has 36 exposures. I've got 180 opportunities to take some great shots.</p>
      <p>I have no idea how this is going to turn out. None of this film has been cold-stored, so it's likely to have degraded some over the years. That could mean that it's unusable, or it could be that it has acquired some interesting character. The great thing about this is that I'll have to shoot it and process it to find out. Processing the Scala will be tricky: there were never a lot of places that did the job, and from what I can tell, there's only one place left in the US that will do it these days. The Portra won't be quite as difficult, but even then, I'll be starting fresh. I can't remember the last time I had to get film processed. The place I used to get my stuff done closed years ago.</p>
      <p>My hope is to produce some images that I'm proud of, images that I want to share with the world. Regardless of how they turn out, I am looking forward to taking those 180 shots. Shooting on film is constrained in a way that digital is not. Each shot exhausts a finite resource. That constraint will require me to be deliberate and careful with each shot. The fact that I am shooting on largley extinct film makes that constraint even more acute. And I am looking forward to sharing what I create when I am done.</p>
